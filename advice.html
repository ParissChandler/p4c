        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> At the beginning of the converstaion, if you are in a hurry and want to get
           the most important information out, let the other side know that have limited time.
           Schedule to discuss more of the conversation later.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> You cannot control what other people think or want, but you can control
        what you want. Make sure to be positive about what it is that you want to accomplish
        from the conversation. Be sure that this accomplishment is the root of the problem.</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Do not be afraid to share your needs with the other side. After all, how will they
          know to provide you with the correct answers if you do not let your needs be known. Don't
          assume that they can read signals.</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Ask the other side what they want. You'd be surprised by how honest and open people
          can be when you make them feel comfortable and safe enough to be so.</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong class="second-best">Second Best</strong> - think about other alternatives to the situation in case
            the conversation will not work. Then pick only <strong class="one">one</strong> option that seemsmost
            reasonable and attractive. This is your second best. Try to improve it so it will be even
            more attractive. Think for a moment, how you would feel walking into a conversation with a
            backup idea. Having a plan B in case your plan A falls short, makes you feel more prepared,
            confident, and powerful.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Even if you disagree - try to listen to the other side. Sometimes people just want
          to be heard which can make all the difference.</p>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> Try to let the other side understand that you both have a similar goal. Even if there
          is a gap in your desires/thoughts, etc., you both still want to solve the problem.</p>
        <p><strong>8.</strong> Sometimes the other side just wants a sincere apology. It can be more valuable than
          any compensation.</p>
        <p><strong>9.</strong> As long as you are happy with the goals you set for yourself, it will be a successful
          conversation. There are no winners or losers.</p>
        <p><strong>10.</strong> There are no rules. Each dispute can be solved in multiple ways. Get creative!</p>

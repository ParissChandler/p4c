        <p>"Prepare4Conversation" is a non-profit website with a mission to
          help anyone in need of organizing thoughts, in a simple and interactive
          way, to prepare for a conversation. The goal is to help you achieve a smoother
          process when dealing with differences between you and the other side.
        </p>
        <p>This website contains universal questions that can be applied to preparing for
          <strong>any</strong> conversation (family,boss,friends,etc.) that one tends to avoid.
          To get ready, you simply need to follow the questions and fill in the answers. You
          are the only one who can view your answers. Think about if what you want from the other
          side, is what they want from you. Is it fair?</p>
          <p>Once you've finished your preparation, you may send a copy to your email. You may
            also go back at any time to either edit or change your preparation. It will be saved until
            you decide to delete it and begin an entirely new preparation.</p>
          <p>In a conversation of more than two partcipants, you will have to fill a prep sheet
            separately for each participant you will be preparing to speak to.</p>
          <p><strong>Keep in mind 3 things:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>This website will help you prepare for a conversation, not to make decisions.<li>
            <li>This website is against verbal or physical violence of any kind.</li>
            <li>This is not legal advice.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Good luck!</p>

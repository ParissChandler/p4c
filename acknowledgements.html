      <p>This website is inspired by a theory from the book,
      "Getting to Yes", by Roger Fisher and William L. Ury.
      (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_to_Yes)
      And, "Difficult Conversations" by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila Heen.
      Foreword by Roger Fisher.I would like to acknowledge Carri Hulet and Toby Berkman.
      As my lecturers for the course,"Negotiation and Dispute Mediation" at Harvard Law School,
      they encouraged me and took the time to advise regarding the creation of the website.
      I would like to thank Resilient Coders for helping develop and design this website.
      Special thanks to Pariss Chandler, who was in charge.I hope you will find much value in
      this website and will commit by practice what you learn to whatever challenging conversation you do.</p>
